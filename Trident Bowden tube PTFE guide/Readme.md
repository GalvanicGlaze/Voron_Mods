I've made some adjustment after some feedback from the community.

Changes made over V1:

- Added a option to have F695 bearings incorporated 
- Enlarged the tube opening
- Added cable/zip tie openings 
- Added spot for 1mm piano wire if needed.
 

Recommended print settings:

- Voron print settings (4 walls, 40% infill and 5 top and bottom layers)
- Turn off thin walls
- Bridge setting: keep only bridges (watch out for bridging for cable tie holes)
- 0.2mm layers and 0.2mm first layer
- No need to adjust for ABS shrinkage 
 

Required Hardware:

- M3x8 Bolt and M3 T-nut
- M5 bolt to suit option.
- Optional M5 nut if you can fit it with the bearing option.

# V1 - PTFE bowden tube guide and CANBUS wire support
This is can found inside the zip files and of the initial release

Required Hardware:

M3x8 Bolt and M3 T-nut
M5x10 Bolt or a M5x8/12
Optional 4mm drill bit for cleaning out bowden tube path

About

In my 350 build the PTFE tube kept getting caught so I made this arm to keep it up. The shorter arm works better so I recommend using it instead
The setup has also been used by a few user to support their CANBUS wires (zip tied to the reverse bowden)

Install

Drill out bowden guide with 4mm drill bit for a perfect fit (optional)
Bolt mount to rear frame with M3x8 and tnut putting the lip at the top
Screw arm on with M5x10 (I used a M5x8mm and it works fine) into the plastic allowing the arm to still be able to swivel
